# Fleming ðŸ”—

A simple blockchain implementation in Rust, built from scratch for educational purposes. Named after Ian Fleming, the creator of James Bondâ€”a playful connection between "Bond" and the financial instrument.

## Overview

Fleming is a basic blockchain that demonstrates the fundamental concepts of distributed ledger technology:
- Block creation and chaining
- Cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
- Transaction management
- Chain validation

This project accompanies the "Designing Blockchain" article [series](https://dsvynarenko.hashnode.dev/series/designing-blockchain-rust) on HashNode.

## Features

- Block creation with cryptographic hashing
- Transaction handling
- Chain validation

## Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Cargo

## Usage
To build and run:
```
cargo build
cargo run
```
To run tests:
```
cargo test
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement account based model and state management
- [ ] Add more sophisticated transaction types
- [ ] Implement basic RPC API
- [ ] Add peer-to-peer networking
- [ ] Implement proof-of-stake consensus
- [ ] Add smart contract support (Lua or Python)
